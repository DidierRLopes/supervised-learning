    "# 7. Model Tuning and Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7.1. Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step after selecting a model and training it is to tune the hyperparameters to optimize performance. Hyperparameters are settings that control the learning process of the model, such as learning rate, regularization strength, number of trees, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several techniques for hyperparameter tuning:\n",
    "- **Grid search**: Exhaustively search over a predefined set of hyperparameter values\n",
    "- **Random search**: Randomly sample hyperparameter values from a defined search space\n",
    "- **Bayesian optimization**: Use a probabilistic model to guide the search towards promising hyperparameter values\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to find the hyperparameter values that lead to the best performance on a held-out validation set. This is often done within a cross-validation loop to ensure the selected hyperparameters generalize well\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other important considerations:\n",
    "- Feature engineering can have a big impact on model performance\n",
    "- Evaluate using appropriate metrics for the problem (accuracy, F1, RMSE, etc.)\n",
    "- Monitor for overfitting and underfitting during tuning\n",
    "- Techniques like early stopping can help prevent overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "So in summary, hyperparameter tuning is a critical step to optimize a model's performance after selecting and training it. Techniques like grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization are commonly used to find the best hyperparameter values\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7.2. Ensemble Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble methods are techniques that create multiple models and combine them to produce improved results compared to a single model. The main idea is that when weak models are correctly combined, more accurate and robust models can be obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main categories of ensemble methods:\n",
    "- **Bagging**: Bagging involves training multiple models independently on different subsets of the training data and then averaging their predictions. It aims to reduce the variance of a single model. Popular bagging methods include random forests.\n",
    "- **Boosting**: Boosting trains models sequentially, with each new model focusing on the instances that were misclassified by the previous models. The predictions are combined using a weighted average. Boosting reduces bias and includes methods like AdaBoost and gradient boosting\n",
    "- **Stacking**: Stacking trains multiple different model types on the same data, then uses another model to learn how to best combine their predictions. It can leverage the strengths of diverse models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The success of an ensemble depends on factors like how the base models are trained and combined. Ensemble methods have been widely used in machine learning competitions to achieve state-of-the-art results\n",
