Then, prepare the data by handling missing values, removing outliers, encoding categorical variables, and scaling/normalizing numerical features."

    "- **Understand the context and domain**: Gather information about the context and domain from which the data was collected. This can provide valuable insights into the meaning and relevance of the features, as well as potential data quality issues or biases.\n",

    "- **Check for data quality issues**: In addition to identifying missing values and outliers, look for other data quality issues such as duplicates, inconsistent formatting, or invalid values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explore feature distributions**: Visualize the distributions of individual features using histograms, box plots, or violin plots. This can help identify skewed distributions, multimodality, or other patterns that may require specific data transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Analyze feature correlations**: Calculate and visualize the correlations between features, either using scatter plot matrices or correlation matrices. This can help identify redundant features or potential multicollinearity issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Investigate feature-target relationships**: For supervised learning problems, explore the relationships between the features and the target variable. This can be done using scatter plots, box plots, or other visualization techniques, depending on the data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Identify potential interactions**: Look for potential interactions between features, as these may reveal important patterns or relationships that could improve model performance."

    "- **Data transformation**: Apply appropriate transformations to the data, such as log transformations, box-cox transformations, or other non-linear transformations, to address skewed distributions (e.g. individual income) or improve the linearity of relationships between features and the target variable. Applying these transformations can normalize skewed data distributions, enhance model performance, reduce outlier influence, and stabilize variance, ultimately leading to more accurate and robust predictive model.\n",
