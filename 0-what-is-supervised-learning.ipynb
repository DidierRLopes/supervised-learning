    "#### What is unsupervised learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is given unlabeled data as a training set. Unlike supervised learning, there are no correct output values; the algorithm determines the patterns and similarities within the data, as opposed to relating it to some external measurement.\n",

It is used to draw inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses. Typical applications include exploratory data analysis to find hidden patterns or groupings in data."
